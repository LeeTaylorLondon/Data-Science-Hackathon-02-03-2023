-Doitforme wants to be the digital marketing assistant of the professional service providers giving them tools to get advertised on their own as much as possible. All these tools are based on the Business Manager APIs Integration. Doitforme also aims to provide professional service providers with basic digital marketing skills. Every user has access to personal admin tool to configure his profile. The Majority of professional service providers in Europe don't have basic skills of digital marketing in order to use free digital marketing platforms such us business manager for their advertisement. They don't know how to analyze the advertising results and measure the success of the campaign. Day by day the number of professional service providers and small sized businesses that use Facebook business manager to get advertised grows. In the near future every business will get advertised online. We must fill the gap by educating them on how can they run digital campaigns & how can they analyze the ad reportsin the easiest way possible.
Right now we are totally bootstrapped but we need seed funding to accelerate our scale up process mostly for marketing and sales
