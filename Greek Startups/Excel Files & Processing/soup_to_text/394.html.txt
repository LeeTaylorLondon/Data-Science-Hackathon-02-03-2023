A new emerging category of spirits, which behave in a drinkability perspective like alcoholic spirits, are 0% alcohol. The formulation in the absence of alcohol is an excellent source of nutritional requirements for microorganisms to grow. Other parameters, like alkalinity pH >3,5, and non controlled storage temperature, increase the risks of microbial growth in the products. .As a result almost all of the non-alc products use preservative to ensure the stability , safety and shelf life of the product, before first opening, while contribute to the prevention of microbial growth once the bottle is opened. Preservatives in the backlabel harm the marketability and brand value of such products, and in the end do not work properly as their potency and efficiency is not enough for 30-or more openings and storage at room temperature for weeks, which may well happen at a restaurant / bar / hotel and also home use, since the consumer perception is that they behave like old school spirits.
Phase 1 (R&D, IP costs and 3.000 pcs to test with market ) : 275k euroThe purpose of this investment is to enable the Company to bring its product to market and raise additional capital. Phase 2 (Production Facility): 1.6M euro
Fully working and lab-tested functional prototype. There is interest (signed NDA’s) and initial ongoing discussions with top level management about patent licensing, with top industry players.Our product falls into directly within their “safety closures“ primary business, and currently they do not have a solution for the non-alc sector. Also with top 3 brand owners of non-alc spirits. However, instead of out-licensing, we explore also opportunities if we invest in in-house R&D and finally manufacturing of the sterile closures.

Provide technical solution to the stability, shelf life and food safety problems of non-alc spirits
Our PATENTED technology is applying during the bottling of a product , within the neck of the bottle, a pourer with 2 nozzles/orifices Technical Benefits preservative free non-alc spirits Innovative technology with airclean barrier, guarantees that drink inside the bottle is intact even with cap opened, and at all possible circumstances Prevents the non-alc spirits from growing microorganisms/yeasts/moulds even after unlimited openings / servings Does increase the shelf-life / durability and guarantees food safety of the non-alc spirit after bottle’s first opening Economical solution, can be “snap on” during bottle filling & capping. Brand Owners Benefits Aligned with the ever-growing trend towards health awareness and wellbeing no product recalls, and bad reputation for 0% products
Business/Revenue Model & Product DistributionFurther Develop & finalize the commercial prototype, and own the only technology and designs -Keep know-how & technology internally -Invest in assembly line -Patent secures the company technological lead and exclusive solution of the problem for the non-alc spirits space. Route to market : Produce the snap-on closure in Greece (the part inside the bottle neck) and sell B2B to one exclusively or more spirits closures global players, who will then market it with decorations and adjustments to their screw caps (usual solutions with metal /plastic /wood caps, etc) Market Development Due to the nature of our current business , there is an existing network of brand owners and non - alcoholic spirits companies & bottlers we can directly reach out and present the solution.Some of them have been already been briefed and have shown interest in the solution
Cutting edge of low-and no-alcohol innovation Rethink / change the industryBenefits for : Brand OwnersAlligned with the ever-growing trend towards health awareness and wellbeing , -“No Preservatives” is the top “clean label” claim, and preservatives is the the most unwanted food additive.Their absence gives competitive advantage over competition and “natural” claim amplifies key message and gives value to the product. -“Clean label” will become more important for non alcoholic spirits, along with transition and establishment of distributionfrom on- to off-trade mainstream channels.-Polishes the health and wellness key message, (e.g no alcohol which is healthy , but preservatives, which never existed in alcoholic spirits)Bottlers : Sodium benzoate “E211” most commonly used in non alcoholic beverages, and other preservatives, will soon be not regulatory compliant with authorities.Value Chain : Durability & Shelf lifeExpiration once openedNot refillable.Consumers : Proper handling by consumer (refrigerators, short shelf life once opened) is usually neglected, but with sterile pourer these can be surpassedNo allergensBetter taste, as preservatives alter taste.Food safetyCan be verified through the mobile apps that scan label, and inform about side effects and “bad additives”
