Our team consists of Engineers & Scientists committed to producing state-of-the-art numerical models. We are passionate about the sea and therefore we have made the sea our business.
We provide engineers with accurate and easy-to- learn & use numerical models by transforming science into practice and delivering our product as SaaS.
Scientia Maris (a Latin phrase meaning "deep knowledge of the sea") has developed highly accurate simulation software to empower engineers and scientists, worldwide, for designing and constructing ocean & coastal infrastructure works. Simulating physical phenomena in sea water environments, i.e. waves and currents motion, sediment transport, sea bottom and coastline evolution, is mandatory for engineers to design environmentally friendly and cost efficient works in the sea.

Cloud-based simulation software for designing ocean & coastal infrastructure
Innovation stems from our 12+ year research efforts, having developed advanced mathematical equations. We have codified these equations in a parallel computing architecture and we have drastically simplified the setup processes, reducing the required times that users have to spend. We aspire to be the 1st to market fully cloud-based simulation software, providing SaaS benefits to users. Given the climate change and the aim of states to adapt and mitigate, the market will be growing extremely fast in the coming years, in order to protect coastal communities.
