The Kalchas Platform, will be saled gradually:A. The Kalchas Platform will be sold to doctors and Health Units into Greece and Worldwide.B. At large medical spaces (Hospitals, Clinics, Nursing Homes, Rehabilitation Centers)C. In the domestic market of a telemedicine platform that can be used either in the public health system (eg: remote or understaffed health centers), or in the armed forces (eg: remote military units, warships at sea ), or in the wider private sector (eg: private hospitals, insurance companies)As it is decribed into the attached document below, the incomes from Kalchas Sales will gain in a 5-year plan:2022 - 2.100.000,00 €2023 - 4.500.000,00 €2024 - 7.300.000,00 €2025 - 10.700.000,00 €2026 - 15.100.000,00 €
IoT sensors research software development using artificial intelligence and machine learning
Funding for software development is subject to the "Development Law - GreeceStrong Development "sub-chapter E ', article 59.The estimated cost for the production amounts to € 19,000.00 per month, inclof insurance contributions, relating to the payroll of employees, their costsinstallations, and costs for technological equipment. The project has estimated time6 months of development, but for another 4 months after the first issue it will be necessary tothe team's involvement with it, of course in parallel with its uninterrupted operation. This costconcerns the first period of operation of the group, until the disbursement of funding byabove development law. At this point additional recruitments should be made butand the reassessment of existing salaries depending on the outcome of its developmentsoftware.In addition, in the first month the amount of € 20,000.00 for material equipment will be necessary in order toaccelerate growth and achieve the goals in the foreseeable future.We estimate that at this stage of the project the only requirements that exist are their coverageneeds for the salaries of employees until 30/06/2022, now the initial cost ofequipment.Project Kalhas along with the accessories are estimated to make a lot of moneyshort period of time, in two main axes:• Profits from the sale of mechanisms• Profits from subscriptions for the use of the softwareRegarding the sale of Vitalerter mechanisms

The company invests and is active in the digital medical technology marketThe company, listening to the demands of the time which favor the turn to telemedicine as never before, decided to invest in it both in the field of medical devices of telemedicine Artificial Intelligence, and in the field of telemedicine software with Artificial Intelligence.The company found that the conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have created specific operational problems (and not only) in health / hospitality structures that need to be resolved quickly to make them viable and functional again.There was a shortage of medical staff and at the same time a lack of available financial resources so that this gap could be filled immediately. It has also been observed that despite the rapid improvement of artificial intelligence in our daily lives in many areas, similar progress has not yet been made in telemedicine.So we moved on to solving the problem of understaffing by developing remote diagnostic tools that use Artificial Intelligence.
We have created a platform and We use the bio signals that result from the IoT devices (internet of things) and after analyzing the generating data, together with the patient data and the opinion of the treating physician, a pattern emerges and with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning can predict and analyze different types of diseases by comparing the pattern.The platform has already been embraced with great interest by the University Hospital of Heraklion and the commander of the hospital authorized us to form a scientific team with the professors of neurosurgery, cardiology and neurology who are part of the development team.The goal of the platform is after the completion to receive bio signals from any IoT device (internet of things) and to predict and analyze diseases depending on the data it receives and as the IoT devices evolve and produce more data, so the platform will evolve and will accept more data to analyze

A pandemic that none of us expected and no one could face and this resulted in a different regularity that requires new rules.At this stage, in the field of medical - technological products with health applications that interact with artificial intelligence, there is no competition in Greece.Worldwide, telemedicine due to its high demands does not have so many solutions to show even while it is vital there are not many products that have entered the magical world of IoT (Internet of Things) worldwide using artificial intelligence.
