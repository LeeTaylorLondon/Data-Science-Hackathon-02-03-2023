DeepSea is a maritime technology company specialising in vessel performance monitoring and optimisation.We combine many years of experience in the shipping industry with deep expertise in the fields of software, hardware and Artificial Intelligence. We are passionate about creating products that help our clients make data-driven decisions to lead the industry forward.
The founding team: Roberto Coustas, CEO (Education: UCL & Oxford Uni., MEng & MSc) and Konstantinos Kyriakopoulos, CTO (Education: Uni. Of Cambridge, MEng & PhD). The company consists of 60 employees (agents included). The percentage of employees (founders excluded) per Department is: Commercial 7%, Business 5%, People Ops 3%, Product 7%, Internet of Things 14%, Software Development 33%, AI Research 19%, Technical Operations 12%. The company has 8 Directors, with multiple Masters and PhDs. Most of the team members are extremely qualified: 27% have a Bachelor’s degree, 17% a MEng degree, 43% hold two Master’s degrees (MEng and MSc or MBA), 12% a PhD. Finally its worth noting that 80% of all the company’s employees are engineers.
We offer the first truly AI powered platform for energy, operational, maintenance and compliance optimisation of commercial ships.Cassandra our performance optimization tool:Real-time vessel monitoring of key performance dataAI-based insights, such as real-time hull fouling and fuel overconsumption for each vesselAutomatically AI generated reports and alerts for key stakeholdersPythia our routing optimization platform:Optimal voyage route for individual vessels based on key parameters such as route, speed, trim, vessel characteristics, ETA and charter party contract.Overall fuel savings, which can reach 8%. This directly correlates to lower carbon emissions.Our environmental compliance tool:Accurate fleet carbon footprint monitoringEnvironmental reports for authoritiesPrerequisite for Cassandra and Pythia is live streaming of data from the vessel, enabled by our custom-designed IoT devices that interface with a vessel’s various sensors.

We’ve developed from scratch novel AI algorithms to solve previously unsolved problems in vessel performance, specifically:learn and update in real time a model of a vessel’s hull which can predict energy consumption at any speed, loading, weather and sea conditionsaccurately quantify the effect of the unseen variables of hull and propeller fouling under any conditionlearn and update in real time a model of main engine on a vessel so that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions can be predicted given power and engine conditionsadapt models from vessel to vessel so that accurate predictions can be made even in the absence of on-board sensorsThis allows us to:simulate fuel consumption and emissions under arbitrary conditions, which enables us to detect unjustified fuel consumptionsimulate the benefits (cash and CO2 savings) from cleaning and other interventionsaccurately determine and simulate the effect of weather and sea conditions on fuel consumption and adjust to remove this effect so that fair comparisons can be made, specifically:comparison of actual performance (in any condition) with sea trials, charter party agreementsprovide the vessel with a tailored route for any journey to minimise emissions and fuel cost given the vessel’s unique performance and fouling characteristics The core AI is a platform technology that could be applied in other industries.The use of both products may save up to 10% of fuel consumption and thus CO2 emissions.
We use AI to optimise vessel performance, routes and CO2 emissions in the shipping industry
