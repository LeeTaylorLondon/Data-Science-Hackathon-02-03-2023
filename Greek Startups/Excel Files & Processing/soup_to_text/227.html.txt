Founders:Dr. Christos Ioakeimidis (CEO) holds a D.Ing in Mech Eng (GR, 1994), an MSc in Mech & Aerospace Eng. (USA, 1996), a PhD in Mech & Chemical Eng (UK, 2001) and an MBA (GR, 2007).Dr. Konstantinos Genikomsakis (CTO) holds a D.Ing in Elec & Comp Eng (GR, 2003), an MSc in Systems Eng & Mngmt (GR, 2005) and a PhD in Production Eng & Mngmt (GR, 2010).The co-founders along with employees comprise a very passionate and highly knowledgeable team which combines the required experience and scientific expertise with the leadership, network of collaborations/partners, and the vision not only to commercialize the product, but also to become a global player in Smart Cities solutions in a few years. Thus, the answer to “Why us?” is because “We have enough resources to get started, but not to reach our 'cruising speed'”.Based on our growth strategy, the current efforts in 2021 are concentrated in establishing the company as a function of its sales in Greece (especially under a B2B approach and via discussions with targeted large customers and potential strategic partners), in selected countries in EU (mainly BE, ES, NE, LUX) in mid-2021, and later in other major EU countries (GE, FR) and the USA (2022-23), and globally (2023 and afterwards). Based on that approach, revenues generated by the sales will be invested also in R&D so as to add new features that will enable us to expand and complement the field of potential applications to all kinds of possible buildings.

Intelligent, innovative and sustainable solutions for Smart Cities and Communities
Inteligg P.C. has developed a self-learning and self-adjusting smart thermostat system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques deployed on the Cloud, supporting multi-zonal control of heating/cooling systems for high energy savings in large and complex buildings up to 40%.More specifically, the developed smart thermostat system brings home automation technologies to a new level by implementing remote control of multi-zonal heating/cooling systems via Wi-Fi connected sensors and by employing AI algorithms to automate the energy consumption behaviour detection, thermal modelling of a building, energy demand prediction and optimization, as well as MPC techniques to boost the energy savings by optimally controlling the heating/cooling systems.The key components of the self-learning and self-adjusting smart thermostat system are the main thermostat module(s), the sensor module(s) enabling the monitoring of more than one heating zones and/or areas in a heating zone, the controller module(s) for sending commands to the heating and cooling systems, the web/mobile App providing access to the dashboard for monitoring real-time information and controlling commands, and the Cloud-based platform for collecting data, storing, processing, predicting, and analysing energy consumption data.
We have a number of pilots in 4 different EU countries, either completed, in-progress or in planning, with potential customers to buy our product. Specifically:-Municipality Building (Town Hall) in Greece (Thessaloniki)-Headquarters Office Building and Industrial Building in Greece (Athens)-Residential House in Greece (Thessaloniki) (completed / preorder)-Greek Orthodox Church in Luxembourg (Luxembourg) (via direct contract – completed / preorder)-Office/Residential buildings in Belgium (La Louviere, Brussels) (completed / preorder)-Municipality Building (Public Library) in Spain (Pamplona) (via International Competition)Selected achievements include:-EU patent EP20386043.2 (pending)-Seal of Excellence by the European Commission-First Greek SME to receive funding thrice for Intellectual Property protection by EU (IP4SME)-Finalist of the MIT Enterprise Forum Greece Startup Competition 2019-3rd Place Award in EIT Jumpstarter Competition-3rd Place Award in GreenTech Challenge 2020-Finalist in K-StartUp Challenge 2020 Accelerator-Finalist in PowerUp! Challenge 2020 (Greece) by InnoEnergy-Semi-finalist in MIT Enterprise Forum Greece Startup Competition 2020-Finalist in Cleantech Camp 2020 by InnoEnergy-Selected in Ignite Ideas II 2020 Greece (ongoing)
The self-learning and self-adjusting smart thermostat system developed by Inteligg P.C. is a game-changing innovation which learns the correlation of occupants' comfort preferences with environmental quantities and chooses the temperature that leads to the optimum level of comfort; uses the space's thermal profile, weather forecast and indoor and outdoor environmental values, and gives appropriate commands to the heating / cooling systems to achieve the optimum temperature (within a reasonable time) in the space with lower power consumption.From a technological point of view, the developed solution is particularly scalable, supporting a higher number of interconnected devices (thermostat modules, multi-sensor modules and controller modules) for enhanced monitoring and higher energy savings in various types of buildings compared to existing solutions in the market.From an entrepreneurial perspective, the business model is also highly scalable, given that:(i) it is based on a B2B2C approach consisting of the up-front purchase of the devices (thermostat, sensor and controller modules) via product distributors (B2B) or the online electronic store of the company (B2C), and an annual subscription fee for the analysis of the energy consumption data.(ii) the global market size of smart thermostats is expected to grow to 7.7 billion € by 2026, with an annual growth rate of 26%.
