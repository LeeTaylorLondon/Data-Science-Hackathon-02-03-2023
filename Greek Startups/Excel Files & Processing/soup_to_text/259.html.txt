LearnWorlds is a powerful, easy-to-use, and reliable training solution for individuals and enterprises. A fully customizable, white-label solution to train employees and associates, educate customers, or sell online courses to a wide audience.
LearnWorlds was started when three former e-learning researchers identified the need for an e-learning platform whose primary objective would be the actual learning itself instead of the management of learning. LearnWorlds co-founders George Palegeorgiou, Fanis Despotakis, and Panos Siozos, graduated from the Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Greece and worked since 1999 as e-learning researchers and software engineers. George and Panos both hold a PhD from the same department.
