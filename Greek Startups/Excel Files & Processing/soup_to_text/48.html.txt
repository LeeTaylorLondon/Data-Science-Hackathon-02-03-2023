In today’s global economy it is becoming more and more apparent that the majority of the printing companies are faced with numerous challenges both internally and externally from brand owners and FMCGs, such as increasingly pressure for price reductions, SKUs proliferation, smaller Lot sizes, less waste combined with faster turnaround times, and on the other hand adaptation to new technologies and trends (Industry 4.0, workflow and process automation, integration).With BEL’s end-to-end Management Information System, printers have access to the information necessary to quickly and easily assess their current state and make the process changes required to ensure that they are operating as efficiently—and profitably—as possible.It delivers real-time business information across the range of business processes associated with the production of a product, from the time the customer decides to buy, through quoting and estimating, production and distribution. It enables the operator to obtain real-time information about a job, a cost center, a customer, inventory and traceability, or any other relevant aspect of the business. Additionally, our solution can reduce administrative overhead by eliminating the need to manually collect and track data, production counts, machine hours, waste and other information that can be easily and automatically integrated with today’s automated printing and finishing equipment and sent directly to the MIS solution.
Our innovation and competitive advantage is mainly driven by technology. More specifically:(1) Modular and scalable offering to adjust to any flexible packaging printer and converter production facility(2) SaaS offering with client web accessing capabilities for order placement, production and delivery stages monitoring (3) Integration with various prepress and color management systems, production floor equipment, quality and inspection systems for automated data collection(4) Application of IoT technologies for automating and controlling various production processes(5) Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, for cost estimation and production optimization Our software is offered on a modular SaaS basis i.e., a fee per year based on the number of users and purchased modules of our offering including the license to use for one-year, new versions, after sales support, and hosting.
