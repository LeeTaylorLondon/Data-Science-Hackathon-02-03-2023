Funding can potentially be required for the growth to new markets such as in the US, Canada, EU and MENA countries. These requirements can reach 3 million Euro.
Our systems are producing a number of free radicals emitted though the air-conditioning systems of any building by specialized stand alone devices. The radicals are neutralizing any and all types of pathogens that are present within the volume of the building. Moreover, they reduce NOx and formaldehydes up to 90%, sharply reduce VOC's and any related smell, being from smoke, smog or other. In addition, we utilize the photocatalytic feature of our systems in paints and sprays to further enhance the results caused by the systems installation in the building's air-conditioning. And all these results are achieved by exciting the photocatalyst with visible light WITHOUT using UV. The results are phenomenal as the intra hospital infections are sharply reduced up to eradication, patients mortality rate drops, patients spending days in ICU's is reduced or avoided at all, indoor air quality is improved and indoor air known carcinogens are reduced up to 10 times within the buildings.
Our Corporation is innovative as it utilizes, applies and successfully markets an internationally patented product that has been applied since 2014 in hospitals and tunnels. The most important aspect of the products and related systems is that it is providing all the relevant benefits in indoor areas without the use of UV radiation that is harmful for humans health.The market size is expected to grow at 5,7 bn USD annually by 2027.The systems are already installed in the B ICU of Papanikolaou hospital in Thessaloniki (airconditioning and paints). The results after 5 months from installation are remarkable as no MDR, PDR or XDR was detected at all 40 points probed. It is also installed in Canada, Singapore, in clinics and offices. In addition distributors have been appointed in Greece, Singapore, Canada, USA, Germany, Bulgaria and in the UK.
At the moment, the technology has been shared in Singapore and applied to the following customers:1. Papanikolaou Hospital.2. Alpha Channel Thessaloniki.3. Trian Maritime Shipping Company.4. Internationl investment Broker's firm in Central Macedonia.5. Greek Airforce HQ's
