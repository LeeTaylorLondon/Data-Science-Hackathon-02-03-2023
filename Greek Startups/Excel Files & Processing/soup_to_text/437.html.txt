We had to build the infrastructure to operate as a travel agent (get direct booking and sign direct contracts with hotels) as it was a necessity to improve our revenue per visitor
Travelmyth is the hotel recommendation engine for sophisticated travellers seeking unique holiday experiences.With 60 unique categories, you can choose and combine any category to find your perfect accommodation.We answer advanced hotel search queries based on your interests and recommend the best hotels. Then we compare prices from the biggest booking sites to find the best deal for each hotel. It's up to you then to book on our booking partners or book on Travelmyth. We currently have 4,919,322 hotels in 60 categories.Why another hotel search engine?Hotel searches in specific categories are poorly answered or not answered at all by our competitors.Try to search for beachfront hotels or for skyscraper hotels or for hotels with infinity pools. In unique categories you’ll end up finding blog posts with the 10 best hotels when in reality there could be 1000s of them.In popular categories like dog-friendly hotels or hotels with swimming pools you’ll find a list with many hotels, but the first results will not be the dog-friendliest hotels or the hotels with the best swimming pools. The search results look broken in most categories on our competitors’ sites.

Founders:John Nousis and Stefanos Vasdekis: internet entrepreneurs since 1998, when they co-founded their first business, a free web hosting company that was paying back its members. Since then, they have co-founded several other internet businesses, including an e-commerce SaaS platform for small businesses, an online software store, a webmasters’ portal, a web development/marketing agency and a social network for students.They’re both experienced in several aspects of building and growing internet companies and they’re the core developers. Studies: Physics and Civil Engineering.
We have built proprietary technology (sophisticated algorithms and machine learning models) and we collect information not available anywhere else online, allowing us to respond to long tail search queries even in the most unique categories.In addition, we have developed several proprietary tools to support our operations:
A network of travel websites with its own publishing platform

Our plan is to focus on very specific categories, make them perfect and dominate them. Then, focus on broader categories where we could have a strong advantage.It takes several years to unfold our strategy, because:
Skyscanner started in 2002, first funding £2.5M in 2008, exit in 2016
Trivago started in 2005, partial exit in 2012, IPO in 2016
We rely on organic search traffic, which takes time to build in a sustainable way
Hotelier support platform incl. photo uploading, processing and tagging, and email client
By providing the best answers to advanced hotel searches, our users can discover hotels that they’ll really like but would never have discovered by using the old methods.We classify hotels in specific categories and then we rank them to bring the best hotels in each category first.How do we classify hotels?We use different method(s) per category, based on:
The hotel search engine for sophisticated travellers: Find the best hotels in unique categories!
Booking started in 1996, was acquired by Priceline in 2005 and slowly became the #1 OTA
Image recognition: We use a hybrid approach of AI and human analysts
At the same time we had to launch in other languages (currently Travelmyth is available in English, Greek, German and Japanese) to reach users interested in our specific categories
