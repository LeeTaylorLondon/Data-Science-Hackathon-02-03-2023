The innovative floating boom (floating barrier- CLEAN TRASH® - CLAIM’s Litter Entrapping Autonomous Network Tactical Recovery Accumulation System Hellas -system) retains, collects and monitors floating litter (that include macroplastics), specifically devised to operate in river mouths and waterways, reached a TRL 9. This highly-efficient solution manages to collect and sustain litter and macroplastics at river mouths before entering into the open sea and affecting the marine ecosystem. The scale model was built at New Naval’s facility in Lavrio, Greece, in late 2018 and a prototype was deployed at the river mouth of Kifissos river in Athens, Greece in 2019, where it was possible to estimate that the system may capture about 95-97% of macrolitter (> 5 mm). The effectiveness and capabilities of the system passed all quality assurance testing, confirming that the system is ready to be installed in active, long-term operational environments. It can continuously retain and remove marine litter from river mouths and be a commercial product purchased by authorities and all stakeholders related to marine litter pollution.
The CLEAN TRASH® system utilizes a combination of active, advanced operational systems and time-tested oil spill response, salvage and marine protection equipment:• Heavy-duty containment boom with solid cylindrical floats with a subsurface skirt contains and guides litter.• Auxiliary fence type booms drive/deflect/pace incoming litter to the collection cage.• A floating foundation attaches to the boom and holds the removable collection cage.• The hot-dipped galvanized steel collection cage utilizes 3 separate collection chambers/levels that lower and raise to store the litter (down to 5 mm in size). The cage is equipped with lifting points and a sliding door.• Independent floats utilize salvage technology to move the storage level. They can be raised and lowered by satellite when a level is filled.• Remote operation and observation versions are available with the development of standalone models optional.Every installation is tailor-made and strategically planned in order for the system to operate with the highest efficiency and effectiveness while addressing the scale of the issue:• System components are custom-built, designed to properly address the environment, location and river of every installation.• The system can be continuously operated, monitored and utilized to collect and compile a litter information database regarding the volume of litter exiting the river and the correlations of these volumes to weather and river fluctuations.
Design and implementation of integrated solutions for the protection of aquatic ecosystems
We want first to focus in Mediterranean countries focusing in 40 rivers that are responsible for 85% of the pollution and then at 80 more achieving 92% reduction in the annual flows of plastics in the Mediterranean Sea.Post COVID-19 pandemic waste increase from gloves, masks and personal protective equipment will result in increased demand for solutions.We are seeking for Business partnerships and further capital increase in order to penetrate additional global markets. We are planning further advancement of automation, remote control technology, green energy resources (solar, wind or hydro power) and land operations for easier removal and transfer ashore.We therefore request €2.600.000 capital investment for:•Studies and model software for the positioning and hotspot identification (200,000 €).•Installation and running supervision for 6 month period in Mediterranean area (300,000 €).•Installation and running supervision for 6 month period out of Mediterranean area (600,000 €).•Development of a service vessel that will allow operational efficiency in remote areas (1,500,000 €).
The system is an unparalleled and highly-efficient solution to manually managing and removing marine litter from river mouths before the litter can enter into a larger body of water where the litter can cause negative effects on the marine environments and where plastics can break into micro and macro-plastics dramatically affecting marine life and marine ecosystems. The system has a highly efficient storage design with multiple levels that can be remotely interchanged when filled.During a systematic 38 days demonstration period of the CLEAN TRASH® system, macro-plastics collected have been quantified and categorized in terms of material type and size, in order to verify the CLEAN TRASH® ability in terms of litter removal. The in situ field-testing of the technology was demonstrated at the Kifissos river estuary (Piraeus, Greece). Within 38 days, a total of 1175 kg of litter was removed during the successful installation at the mouth of the river. The percentage of plastic litter found at the Kifissos river (68-79%) is in line with previous studies on litter collection in another EU river (Rhone river), where plastics represented 77% of the identified items by using the visual observations. These first findings support the potential of this system to be applied in rivers in other geographic areas, thereby increasing our knowledge on macrolitter collection in the river estuaries, before the litter to end up in the sea.
In the framework of the H2020 project CLAIM (Cleaning Litter by developing and Applying Innovative Methods in European seas - https://www.claim-h2020project.eu/), HCMR, NNL and KISS Intelligence decided to establish a spin-off company in order to better exploit the research results and know-how produced in the CLAIM project. The spin-off company will be called «MINDS TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES PRIVATE COMPANY» with abbreviated name «MINDS PC» (where MINDS means “MARINE INNOVATION, DEPOLLUTION & SERVICES”).The shareholders of MINDS are HCMR scientists (54.85%), HCMR (5.40%), the company New Naval (NNL - 23.70%) and the company KOSMOS INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND SERVICES Private Company (KISS Intelligence - 16.05%).The main purposes of MINDS include:1. Design and implementation of integrated solutions for the protection of aquatic ecosystems (marine and inland waters) from pollution, with emphasis on the collection of plastics (macro and microplastics).2. The development, production, selling and exploitation of collection products and waste containment and filtration devices in aquatic ecosystems (marine and inland waters), utilizing already produced prototypes.MINDS will utilize, improve / upgrade / evolve and develop new techniques, methodologies and products - services related to the protection of aquatic ecosystems (marine and inland waters) from pollution, with emphasis on plastic and marine litter collection technologies such as the CLEAN TRASH system.
