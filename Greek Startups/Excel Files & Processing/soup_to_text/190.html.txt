G&G enjoys 2 years of successful commercial presence in Thessaloniki having acquired and maintained more than 250 clients - this stands as proof of concept, market demand and successful commercialization ofthe concept.For all the above reasons, we are confident that the project will have a noticeable success in Athens (this is our next step for the upcoming 6 months) and we will manage to achieve our European expansion.Over the last 2 years, we manage to achieve impressive results such as:✔ Over 250 partners.✔ Over 40 Employees.✔ Secure strategic partners like Instashop, BSK, Delivery.gr and ACS.✔ More than 250.000 successfully delivered orders.✔ Name recognition as a synonymous to quality service and a reliable partner
Our core team, includes:- John Karavas - Chief Executive OfficerΟver 10 years in business development- Prodromos Theocharis - Chief Technology OfficerOver 5 years in delivery as a service industry- Nikos Spanos - Chief Operating OfficerOver 10 years in Courier and transportation industry- Tsitouridis Charalampos - Area ManagerOver 10 years in Courier and delivery industry- Nikos Koumpouras – SKG Operators and Schedule ManagerOver 2 years on orders routing- Artemis Emeinides – HR ManagerOver 10 years on delivery industry- Kostas Manelidis - Fleet & Equipment dispatcherCertificated mechanic and over 2 years on orders routingWe are also cooperating other agencies four our accounting and legal needs.
It is important to emphasize the uniqueness of the services of G&G as there is nothing similar operating in the market. As the company is first to introduce this service to the market, we are confident that it will create a first mover effect and have a competitive advantage over any other company that will try to follow and compete with us. There are currently some companies that are active in providing distribution to restaurants, however their services are attached to an online ordering platform (e.g., eFood) and the services provided are limited to the orders from that specific ordering platform - not the total orders of the restaurant at any given day.Our future targets are the above (% of our income):- 2023 TARGET: 80% Thessaloniki 20% Athens- 2024 TARGET: 50% Thessaloniki 50% Athens. Also, opening to Europe, aiming to the northern of Europe, where Delivery needs are very high- 2025 TARGET: 30% Thessaloniki 65% Athens, 5% EuropeThe potential barrier would be unstable external environment such as fuel price, maintenance costs and overall operational expenses.
