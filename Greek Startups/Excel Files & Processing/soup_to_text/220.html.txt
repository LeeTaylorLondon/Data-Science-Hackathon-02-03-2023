All in one place educational virtual classrooms and learning management systems
All in one place virtual classroom and education institution management software. Bootstrapped, experiencing substantial growth with a global customer base.
PROBLEM: Edtech is too complicated and expensive for must educational outfits. When COVID hit, schools took knee jerk reactions and used free trials with no staff training. Educational institutions are looking for simple yet dynamic solutions to not only hold classes but to also manage them in a secure and efficient environment with adequate teachers and student support.SOLUTION: Infiniti provides an all-in-one-place virtual school that is 5-10x cheaper than direct competitors due to a private server cloud. We provide dedicated and integrated educational classrooms, management systems, payment, homework, library and messaging systems that meet the most stringent EU safeguarding legislation. Online education should be liberating and we provide substantial support and training to all our customers.
