Our business idea is a website / digital platform that operates 24/7 and offers tip-based interactive live-streamed tours from around the world that are conducted by a global network of local tour guides, supported by our own RTE streaming infrastructure.The tours are offered with an option to tip, a live chat to interact with the guides and viewers in real time, a geolocator to watch and follow the guide’s tour and a snapshot feature to save and share snapshots of a tour. Viewers have the opportunity to show their appreciation to the guide hosting the tour with a gratuity (tip). The guide receives a percentage of the total revenue, starting from 60% up to 75%, based on their performance.

Roleplay is a Digital Design Agency operating in Athens since 2013. We are responding to a wide range of digital design assignments - UX/UI / Website / Apps / Branding among others. Technological developments, market trends & new types of streaming & viewing devices are focus areas that we are constantly monitoring so we can always keep up with the market’s evolution and be a step ahead of the competition. We work with innovative design thinking and technology and currently are developing a new virtual streaming service, called Viewpal.
We bootstrapped the launch of the digital platform in December 2021 with the beta version of the Viewpal website. Our roadmap has so far three well-defined stages. On the first stage, we were aimed to develop our MVP, on the second stage to provide proof of concept with the launch of the BETA version of the digital platform, and on the third one to expand our services and reach a bigger audience internationally and create our own streaming infrastructure.Milestones so far:- Market analysis: Competition analysis and market positioning- Business plan- Brand review- UX flows- UI prototype- Database schema- Front end development- User testing- Platform launch - Pilot Phase- Advertising campaign - Reach 2k active usersNext milestones:- Private Virtual Tours Option- Desktop App for “ Home Streaming”- Our own streaming infrastructure- Services expansion - In-person tours- Crowdfunding future trips of guides- Viewer & TV App - Reach 65k users- Loyalty scheme & badges- 360 cameras & VR headsets- Meta-waiting room
We have already created a top notch tech infrastructure and built a wide network of guides, but we need to always be a step ahead and plan our next innovative technological development to offer the best service to our customers. Moving forward we plan to add:-Private Virtual Tours: The guides will have the option to buy, in advance, 60min private streaming “rooms”-Desktop App allowing guides to be able to stream from home, by sharing presentations or images from their computers-Our own streaming infrastructure -Booking in-person tours: Viewers will be able to check the availability of the guide, book in-person tours and exchange private messages with the guide-Crowdfunding future trips of guides: a space where our guides will be able to raise funds for future trips they wish to take-Mobile app for viewers An app that viewers will be able to use and engage more from mobile-TV App: Stream live tours on TV devices-Loyalty scheme & Badges: Implement a loyalty scheme for the viewers based on a point system-360 cameras & VR headsets: Provide our guides with 360 cameras so that they can offer a far more engaging experience to the viewers. This development goes hand in hand with enabling the possibility to watch the live-streamed tours using Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality headsets-Meta-waiting room: A metaverse-type waiting room where guides and viewers can meet up before the tours, developing an interaction that stretches beyond the “boundaries of virtual t
We are currently looking for our seed funding and asking for 100K to expand the technological development of our product and add a series of new features that will make the product more competitive in the streaming market. Moreover the funding will help us form a stronger marketing plan and strategic partnerships.
