Protio is led by Antonios Fiorakis, who previously built and exited the boat rental marketplace “incrediblue”, and supported by a large team of investors and advisors with an immense amount of experience in real estate and other industries.
Due to the early stage of our company and the proprietary nature of our data, we cannot disclose a lot but we can mention that in just a few months of testing our business model, we have already sourced and vetted >1.500 properties through our platform.
