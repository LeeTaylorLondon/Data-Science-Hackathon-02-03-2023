Rokoko aims to disrupt the 3D animation industry by introducing the first real-time collaborative platform for 3D animation – the RokokoMotion Platform. This easy to use and all-in-one platform will comprise components for i) real-time co-creation, management and sharing of animations, ii) seamless integrations with third-party software and hardware and iii) marketplace for assets and plug-ins.Our complete product line is: Hardware-Smartsuit Pro II : A sensor based full body suit for motion capture-Smartgloves: A pair of sensor based motion capture gloves for finger motion capture-Face capture rig: A rig for facial expression capture (requires iphone to work) Software-Rokoko Studio : A subscription software platform that capture data from our hardware and turns them into motion assets-Rokoko Studio Plug-ins: A list of plug-ins that allow our platform to interact with all the major 3D platforms includings Blender, Maya, 3D Studio Max, Houdini, Cinema 4D
Rokoko aims to fill this unaddressed gap in the industry and scale-up the company to a new level by rolling out the first easy to useand all-in-one collaborative platform for all digital content creators to develop, manage and share 3D character animation work in real-time - The Rokoko Motion Platform. The MotionPlatform will significantly reduce the time and cost of mocap development, thus, allowing all digital content creators to do animation work in a faster, easier and more collaborative way. At the same time, the MotionPlatform represents a major business and growth opportunity for Rokoko. Whereas the SSP and associated SW represent a quite successful product, its scale-up potential is limited as the market demand can stagnate once many customers have purchased the suit. On the other hand, the potential for the MotionPlatform is huge with millions of potential customers worldwide added to the large and growing need for creating 3D character animations through a real-time and collaborative process, leading to recurring revenues. Rokoko’s ambition is that the MotionPlatform becomes the platform of choice for 3D character animationwork, like GitHub for SW development orWe are uniquely positions to take advantage of two main avenues. The creator economy and the Metaverse/Web 3.0.Content generation is exploding across the spectrum. SoMe/Metavers platforms are fueling explosive growth among emerging creators. Also, streaming giants accelerate demand for high-end content.
