People don’t know what happens in real time at the shops and what kind of products they serve. Shops don’t know how to find new customers, how to communicate with theexisting ones and spent lot of time to order their products from Distributors. Distributors don’t know their real customers and they do not have the immediacy in the orders placed by the Shops
