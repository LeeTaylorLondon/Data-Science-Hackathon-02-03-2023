Solmeyea’s founders have lived, studied and worked in the EU, US & Africa for 10+ years and successfully launched 3 ventures, separately.What Solmeyea does is sustainable, qualitative and efficient given microalgae’s higher food protein content & its complementary production of feed, pharma, cosmetics & biofertilizers. Moreover we will soon explore the biodegradable bioplastic packaging solutions (coming from microalgal biomass) for the innovative food applications in line with circular bioeconomy models by valorizing the exhausted algae biomass at its fullest extent and gladly contribute to the EU’s 2050 long-term strategy for a climate-neutral Europe by replacing fossil-based plastic packaging with bio-based, renewables.

Solmeyea USP’s being a purpose-driven Agri - BioTech startup producing in the most cost-competitive and eco-friendly way “carbon neutral” high value bioingredient-based proteins:1) undeniably higher content & efficient way for food production, compared to traditional sources, like: Soy & Hay2) incomparably more nutritional and digestible, full of omega 3’s, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, lipids and carotenoids3) verified vertical microalgae cultivation methods (utilizing CO2 & sunlight)4) end products - phenomenal lower carbon footprint
Humanity faces a double-faced problem:overpopulation & livestock revolutioncreating a growing demand for food+protein, which won’t be met due to:land scarcityEarth’s heat-up (CO2 emissions)Food & Feed manufacturers avidly look for soy substitute like microalgae derived proteins, given their double protein content, high digestibility & nutritional value making food industry confident about its end products, avoiding breeding animals’ food shocks or reproduction delays due to low quality & possible contaminations (mold)Solmeyea enables its B2B food & feed industries manufacture high value algal based premium end products for a significant lower cost with a phenomenal lower carbon footprint, abiding by the circular economy’s morals and goals, taking also advantage of the ESG criteria and lowering their debt cost by cutting their existing loans’ interest rates by (5-300 basis points); thus, return the initial CAPEX within the first year due to GHG & carbon footprint reductioWe are using biotech cutting-edge technologies relying on life’s oldest mechanism: photosynthesis: Solmeyea, already awarded with the Seal of Excellence, strategically located at the south-eastern Europe with the highest annual natural sunlight offers a microalga farming producing pure high-value bioproducts, such as: proteins & vitamins to the food industry at a 5x lower cost, utilizing certain CO2 emissions to further boost its microalgae process and create a positive environmental impact
