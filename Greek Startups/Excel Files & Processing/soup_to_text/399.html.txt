Small businesses do not usually have a respectful online presence and consequently the end-user usually prefers bigger companies with better online presence. Such a search aggregator will standardize their online presence and will be recognized of the mass of tourists as a reliable brand in a similar way that Booking.com has done for hotel accommodation. This standardization will contribute to the quality of the international image of Greece.
