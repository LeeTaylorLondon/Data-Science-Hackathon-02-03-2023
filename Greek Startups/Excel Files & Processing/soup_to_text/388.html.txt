Creation and operation of the first digital museum with a various combination of innovative digital installations. The theme of the museum is Lost Atlantis combined with the history of Santorini without the presence of real artifacts.
The problem is solved combining the Museum artifacts and information with a combination of innovative technologies that have not been used in large scale in the museums culture until today.At the museum of Lost Atlantis experience in Santorini, to achieve the best possible result the following technologies are used:Interactive Videos, Interactive Wall, Interactive Floor, Interactive Memory Photos, Augmented Reality, Holograms, 9D Cinema.The combination of these innovative technologies gives to the visitor a unique interactive experience of the theme of the museum.
Our company is giving solutions in two major problems in the Museums culture.The first problem is that Museums all over the world are getting obsolete due to technology advancements. The real artifacts many times do not touch the visitor and especially new generations that are addicted in new technologies and fast information. People today in general are used and pursuit the feeling of experience and intense gathering of information.The second issue that our company is giving solution is how to create a Museum or an exhibition about a subject an idea or a theory without real artifacts.The myth of Atlantis in Santorini and the history that is hidden behind it, is an opportunity to create a Museum based in the solutions to the problems mentioned earlier.
