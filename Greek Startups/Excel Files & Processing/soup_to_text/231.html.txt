IMD Laboratories is a company focusing on both classical and point-of-care biodiagnostics, as well as medical consultation.
Our company focuses on nanomaterial development for the health and environmmental sector
It’s research and development section aims to explore and develop novel diagnostic tools and in specific electrochemical biosensors devices for Point-of-Care Diagnostics, as well as specifically engineered biosensing nanoparticles. Within this frame the recently developed the novel TiO2 based Nabipore working electrodes that are trademark pending in the UK and Greece and can adsorb biomolecules on their surface without altering their activity or stability
Our product development strategy involves creating a new product- the Nabipore electrodes- for the existing biosensor market. We hope that we can both enter the Greek and EU market, as well as going further in developing and integrating our electrodes in a point-of-care sensor device within food technologies.
Our funding needs are primarily focused on capital costs (equipment) as well as revenue costs (salaries, other running costs for consumables).

The company firmly believes that the Nabipore electrodes could enter the biosensor market, which is a fast growing profitable field.
We believe that our Nabipore working electrodes could be scaled up, and from a prototype become mass producible.
