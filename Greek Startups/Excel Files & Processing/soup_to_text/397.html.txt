The Signal Ocean Platform, a B2B SaaS, helps our clients make better-informed decisions, faster and with greater confidence. Our algorithms combine our data with the clients’ data to create customized, exclusive market insights.
Signal’s leadership team combines shipping experience with a passion for technology.
Signal Ocean operates in the shipping transportation market of ocean-going vessels (e.g., tankers, bulkers, containers etc). We create commercial information databases for each of our clients, with past and live market data and movements. We then use these data to create new services and products.
Our algorithms fuse shipping market data with private commercial information that each client has, to create customized, exclusive market insights. The platform enables users to receive an up to date market view in a matter of seconds. The platform automatically updates the information for any ship throughout the day in real time and therefore allows users to make better-informed and faster decisions with greater confidence. It is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than currently used manual methods. To achieve this we use robotics algorithms and concepts from the self-driving cars space adjusted to the maritime industry.
