We are led by a multidisciplinary team combining experience and deep knowledge of publishing and archiving activities as well as scientific research methods and a passion for Open Science. Furthermore, the editorial boards and Scientific Editors of our journals are high ranking academics (>120 in number) from leading universities in Europe and the USA
We are bootstrapped and profitable, however funding for further scaling up is currently being sought
Innovation> Open Access publishing allows academics/industry/laymen to access the full text of published scientific articles without the need for subscriptions or library intermediates, hence lifting the paywall to science. Everyone can access the published results, data, manuscript without barriers from any device without the need for a VPN.> We also publish accompanying data, methods and software hence also promoting the European Commissions "Open Data" project. > A user-friendly submission and handling platform for authors/editors.> Along with standard journal and article options, we allow the publication of a wide range of innovative article types.> Published articles also track and inform readers of the article’s impact and interaction by measuring citations, usage, captures, mentions, and social media activity.Competitive advantage>Our competitive advantage is that we have covered specific niche areas that are not routinely covered in open access journals by large publishers. This is coupled with the fact that the journals are predominantly guided by, and supported by European Scientific bodies (We have 13 scientific bodies supporting our journals - bringing scientists to the forefront of article decision making.> Swift publication of articles, after rigorous peer review in high quality format.
Open Access is the practice of providing online and direct access to scientific manuscripts that is free of charge to the user and is reusable. Open Access to research results, is an essential part of Open Science, which aims to make science more reliable, efficient and responsive, is, therefore, the springboard for increased innovation opportunities. The potential benefits of opening up research information are clearly recognised in the European Commission’s investment plan for Europe where it is stated that in order to ‘boost research and innovation, EU competitiveness would benefit from fewer barriers to knowledge transfer, open access to scientific research and greater mobility of researchers". The European Commission sees Open Access as a tool to facilitate and improve the transparency and circulation of scientific information in Europe - it is this problem that we strive to address, by making Open Access affordable, efficient and fast for researchers in the EU and beyond.

We have developed digital open access scientific journals for academia within the area of Medicine, Pharmaceuticals and Public Health. This academic service is based on a user-friendly submission and handling platform and our team's adherence to the strictest quality criteria and best practices in Open Access academic publishing. In addition to the above, European Publishing develops and invests in Research and Innovation Actions (RIA), including the facilitation of Open Science e-Access platforms, Open Data e-Platforms and Digital academic Publishing Solutions.Currently, the firm has 6 Open Access journals, with more planned in the near future serving primarily academics, the industry, but also the general public from across the globe which benefit from barrier-free access to published research/data which we share/disseminate via our integration with established large research platforms (Web of Science/PubMed/Scopus/Embase etc).The market for "Open Data" in Europe was estimated in 2016 to surpass 55 Billion Euro per year, while between 2016-2020 the Open Data market is estimated to have grown by +37% and currently to surpass 75.7 Billion Euro per year -a growth which is expected to continue due to strong support from the European Commission. Indeed, as Open access to scientific peer-reviewed publications is an underlying principle in the current Horizon 2020 funding calls and the upcoming Horizon Europe funding programme (2021-2027) - this need is estimated to grow.
