We successfully launched our Emergency service during Covid 19 lockdown and we managed to partner with more than 40 hotels in Athens and Thessaloniki, serving their guests 24/7. Our hotel partners are also digitally linked to our health and wellness services, driving traffic to our platform and making the services accessible to their customers and website visitors.We are constantly expanding our members to include the best and most recognized health & wellness providers in the country, designing together with them wellness packages in the fields of Dentistry, Dermatology, Cosmetic Medicine and IVF. So far we have partnered with more than 30 of the best clinics in Greece, including 2 major private hospital groups. We have developed several digital services to support easy communication of the customer with the service providers, scheduling, booking, digitally ordering and paying a health and wellness package in a transparent and user-friendly environment.
