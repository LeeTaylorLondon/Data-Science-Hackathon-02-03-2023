Our current needs are 1.500.000 euros for bringing our MVPs to TRL 9 and establish an aggressive marketing/sales team in Europe and worldwide to reach out our major envisioned sales channels.
On the agricultural side:- 1st award winners of the New Generation for a New Agriculture funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation- Finalists of the H2020 ATLAS AcceleratorOn the healthcare side:- Confidential Multinational Diagnostic Center- Pilot implementation with Papageorgiou Hospital in Thessaloniki and University Hospital of Heraklion- Pilot implementation with Dubai and Rashid Hospital in UAE- Pilot implementation with Hospital General de México in MexicoOn the smart city side:-Municipality of Lasithi Plateau
The core of our solution lies within a set of proprietary algorithms utilizing AI techniques to optimize routine processes while eliminating errors and uncertainties introduced by humans. The algorithms are modified on demand to accommodate the needs of each group of clients, based on a series of available data.We also offer the in-house expertise to develop IoT devices capturing data of interest and a team of experienced data scientists.To facilitate the use of our solution, our service is delivered in a custom-built SaaS platform where input can be easily introduced, processes can be monitored, and analytics on process metrics are reported. So far, our solutions have received awards and positive feedback, domestic and internationally, at pilot and competition phase.

Our innovation lies in that we group the needs of a series of SMEs and create sector-tailor-made products offering the efficiency our competitors offer to large corporations.In addition to that, our algorithms, methods, and approach have proven more efficient and faster than other published state-of-the-art competitors. Indicative of that are the nVIDIA developer award of a paper related to AI-aided diagnostic imaging, the New Generation for New Agriculture funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and the Juan Ramón Guillén Foundation awards for our agritech MVP.Furthermore, the grouping we do for each category of service offering allows us to offer competitive prices. In addition to automation, modern techniques, such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, are utilized to enhance the reliability of the system.On the agriculture side our innovation is funded on the fact that we automate a process by means of IoT devices. In addition to automation, modern techniques are utilized to enhance the reliability of the system, such as computer vision, artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the Decision Support System, actually being implemented utilized innovative technologies such as generative adversarial networks and recurrent neural networks for the optimization of the spatiotemporal pest control action.Same nature of innovations is transferred to the other two sectors with patents currently under evaluation.
In the era of increasing digitalization, the majority of SMEs continuously lose their competitiveness vis-à-vis larger-size corporations. This loss comes typically as a result of economies of scale and digital gap, oftentimes the two main factors driving the cost of manufacturing/service providing.OptiSol.io envisions closing the gap, by identifying key activities driving up cost in SMEs, and that are low-added value, repetitive, with a high degree of human error, lacking optimization. The opportunity we see relates to the Industry 4.0 digital transformation of SMEs and the introduction of modern technologies (IoT, AI) in a cost-effective, fast, and easy manner.Currently our solutions (in product and MVP phase) are focused on the agritech, healthcare, and smart city sectors addressing costs for businesses values at €4B, €650M, and €7B at the EU level, respectively. We see the opportunity in obtaining a portion of that market share by being competitive in terms of innovation and price.
