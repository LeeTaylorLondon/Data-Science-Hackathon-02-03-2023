With the use of specific internet forums and social media, we were able to introduce and promote our product without aggressive marketing. The new technology, fresh design and innovations we brought in, the product spoke for itself.We immediately focused on the premium price range as it was a premium product and the gamble paid off as a startup. We marketed ourselves as a high-end and engineering acumen company that created a hype before we released our products and that gave us a good traction with the market and bring some funds fast.Because of our innovation we became popular in this industry and our products have been shipped out to customers all over the world. We are in the process of expanding our distribution network worldwide, and apart from Europe we have already started a collaboration with a distributor in Australia.At the moment we have created a plan of what is required to scale up in the factory in Greece and what is required to scale up in the global market.We have already got contacts in Europe, United States, Russia, Dubai to release our products in these markets with official support.
At the moment Innovitech is still focusing in growing, so sales are imperative at this point.We've developed a high tech self cleaning water filter for coral systems.Corals are very sensitive organisms and require a stable environment, stable water parameters and a system with not many nutrients in order to keep their vivid coloration.This filter operates in micron levels in order to remove the microparticles that obscure and reflect the light. Also these microparticles will generate nutrients when they brake down in the water column, so removing them with such precision maintains a clean and clear environment for the corals.The precision of this filter is so fine tuned, that we offer media grades of, 9, 17, 25 and 32 microns to our customers, in order to achieve the desired effect in their unique system.Derby University in the UK has purchased one of our products for their coral system where they study and research the unknown world of coral reproduction.
We need funds to get more staff, invest in our own equipment, expand our space and purchase raw materials in bulk which will offer us a better price per unit.As explained above, we have the product, we have the market and we are losing customers because we cannot keep up with demand.We are also buying parts from abroad while we have the knowledge to produce them ourselves but we don't have the funds for the equipment required. Some of these parts could be exported from Greece as a side activity for any excess we might have.In our line of work and in manufacturing, there needs to be always stock in order to cover orders in a timely manner, and keep the manufacturing schedule out of the market demand. Manufacturing should be non-stop anyway, but orders will need to be covered in a timely matter, so any new orders will beed to be paletised and shipped the next day.Any delays we have had in the past has caused us bad reputation and we are always trying to overcome this issue as our sales are constantly growing.Also due to Covid, this industry saw a 30% growth when everybody else had issues. Our issues are limited in getting parts in a timely manner.

Innovation in the current product is that we developed two products that can handle larger water quantities than any of our competitors.We offer a model that there's no match worldwide in respects of water flow and volume of water that it can handle.There's an innovative design and shape of the panels of the filter that is an innovation in the market, where with the research of physics and fluid dynamics we managed to achieve.At the moment we have a model in the pipeline that will support large public aquariums using the same technology, so effectively the technology can be scaled to any level the market requires.We are the first ones that used high tech electronics and optical water level sensors with custom software within them in order to cope in a saltwater environment with the respective impurities.The next version of our filters will be using more advanced software electronics, interfaces that will communicate with advanced aquarium computers and we will be focusing on IoT and cloud technologies to provide the customer with more information at any part of the world.More sensors will be integrated and we will be taking advantage of microwave and IR technologies alongside with hardware that can receive updated software.
Innovitech has started in the United Kingdom and has now expanded it's manufacturing facilities in Greece in order to grow further and develop new products.The Innovitech brand name specifies precisely our main activity, Innovtation through Technology.Every product we develop and manufacture is definitely going to provide something innovative to the market and the end customer. We don't copy, we innovate!Managing director of the company has a tracked record in technological innovation, with his two last projects working for manufacturing giant, Jaguar Land Rover in the Electrical & Electronic Engineering department.Inventor of two worldwide patents and worked on innovative project like bringing in the internet in the vehicle with applications updated over the air and ADAS systems (project management of ADAS architecture) with self driving vehicle technologies.
The team is constantly growing and we have four people working in manufacturing alone. Two people in management and the director that will focus on the market expansion and new product research.Already we have two new products designed and partially tested with extremely innovative features which will put us in the spotlight again for releasing new and different products from what the market has to offer.We still need to scale up in staff and raw materials and that's why we signed up to Elevate Greece. We have the product, we have the technology, we have the plan and new products, but we need to invest more in order to achieve it.All exports are done from Greece and we are giving the opportunity to locals to work on projects and learn things they probably wouldn't anywhere else.At the moment we have customers and markets that want our products, but we have a limited capacity of how many products we can produce per month and we are actually losing sales because of our limited capacity. We never have stock in our premises, whatever is produced is sold already and shipped out.
