CureCancer empowers patients to self-care, maintains quality of life and reduces costs.
CureCancer digital platform allows patients to self-record 100% of their symptoms (PROs), communicate with physicians, “real-world and real-time” and receive early and effective care, based on AI technology. With CureCancer’s telemedicine feature patients interact with physicians when they need to, from a distance.CureCancer can reduce cancer costs by 33% which translates to €46.7 billion savings in Europe per year. PROs also increase the accuracy of clinical trial results, with a positive impact on drug development, economic models and health policy. CureCancer’s innovation is a patient-centric and fully patient-driven platform, which provides real-world and real-time accurate patient data and communication with physician, from distance, upon patient’s request. Our competitors offer some of the above digital services, but lack in one area or another (e.g. one has patient self-reporting symptoms, but cannot be shared with physician; another has symptom tracking shared with physician but no video-call capability). Our beachhead market is Greece, with 73 cancer clinics, about 2,000 cancer HCPs, 67,000 new cancer patients and 500,000 survivors. HCPs would pay the annual fee to access their patients’ files and communicate with them.Hospitals would pay the annual fee to provide CureCancer tool to their HCPs. Research organizations would pay per project to organize clinical trials. we expect a profit of 1,200,000 in 3 years.

CureCancer is a way to facilitate early supportive care to cancer patients to increase cancer therapy success and reduce cancer economic burden. It is a patient-centered and patient-driven platform.Patients self-record their medical history and exams, having direct access to them. They keep track of their therapies, medications, and appointments and self-record 100% of their symptoms, in real-time.Patients share their data with physicians and may have a video call with their physician, through the CureCancer telemedicine feature. They can also book a physical appointment. Unnecessary visits to hospital or outpatient clinic and travel costs can be avoided. As patients noted, using CureCancer, saved them time and money, had better communication with their physicians, felt safe and protected themselves and their families from contacting the COVID-19. Patients can also complete symptom-based questionnaires to increase the accuracy of clinical trial results. CureCancer can provide information to assist in healthcare policy decisions.
We need investors to develop and enhance the immense potential of CureCancer and complement its function, with AI, developing: (1) the app, (2) a chatbot, (3) a tool to predict the oral complications that are specific and related to almost all types of cancer therapy and motivate patient to self-recognize them, report and self-manage or ask medical support, (4) develop a marketplace for healthcare products. We need investors to help with our operational costs in order to expand our services and reach. We expect to meet these needs with 300,000 Euro.
