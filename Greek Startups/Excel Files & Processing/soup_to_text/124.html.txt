A technology platform aggregating cleaning services from suppliers into a unified on-demand offering
Our innovative technology platform is the brain of a 360 ecosystem, providing services to suppliers and end-customers, through various channels. The platform is built on 4 pillars that are offered separately or combined:1. The Digital Platform Module: onboarding new suppliers & servicing end-customers with adapted environments for B2B & B2C2. The Operations Module: digitized & automated workflows integrated with all other operations provided to suppliers3. The Delivery Module: last-mile services, tracking, slotting4. The Production Module: wide range of cleaning services from partners' production units unified in one single service offering easy to sell & promoteMylaundry thus creates an ecosystem of services offered to the different stakeholders: cleaning providers, last-mile services, marketplaces, individual drycleaners etc. e.g.: mylaundry acts as the supply for Marketplaces, offers last mile services to individual dry-cleaners.Innovation comes essentially from the ecosystem technology platform that runs automatically handling all incoming requests, creating & executing all operational workflows & pinpoints opportunities foroptimizations & growth.Sustainability is also at the heart of our activities and operations (in all above-described pillars). Reduction of carbon emissions, electric cars for last mile delivery, optimization of services for consumption reduction, cloud technologies and sustainable offerings to the clientele, creates a unique value proposition.

Mylaundry’s goal is to digitize and manage the customer journey for cleaning services by aggregating services from multiple suppliers into a unified on-demand service offering.Our platform is an ecosystem of suppliers that offer their services under the mylaundry brand to a wide range of digital and non-digital outlets without changing their business model. We have created an operations & delivery platform that accommodatesa growing ecosystem of cleaning suppliers with complementary products, which allows us to offer a complete service.Our platform automates the workflows of pick-up, delivery and allocation to suppliers, so we can have full governance of the customer journey. The existence of multiple complementary services under one roof, coupled with the workflow automations of our platform, allows us to create tailor made cleaning services combos (e.g., house cleaning & laundry & car cleaning), subscription packages, specific B2B offerings.
Our current Funding Needs are estimated to 200.000 Euros for reaching our growth targets until the end of year 2023.
