The 2020 pandemic has caused a tectonic shift in hotel guest expectations for contactless solutions and seamless experiences. Our tools offer fast & cost-efficient solutions in a wide range of areas, facilitating the hotels' digital transformation. As a result, in the past 6 months we have almost doubled our contracts' number, now exceeding 200 hotels, with an accelerating trend both in terms of leads and closures. In parallel, in 2020 we have signed a series of partnerships in key geographies rich in resorts, like the Caribbean, Australia & Pacific Island, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, East Africa that have already led to significant number of deals. Our apps have been used by more than 1mn hotel guests and we have created a highly scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure. In parallel, our native integrations with a series of Property Management System offers us a significant speed and cost advantage (as interfaces tend to be very costly). Because we have reached scale in many areas (e.g. Crete, Kos, Rhodes, Corfu, Kos, Chalkidiki, Santorini), where we typically serve >20% of 5-star resorts, we see a growing number of referral leads. Moreover, we have fine-tuned our SEM & Display digital marketing. A barrier to exponential growth is the long cycle in B2B hotel sales, which typically require trusted referrals.
No funding needs for the moment as we are growing organically
