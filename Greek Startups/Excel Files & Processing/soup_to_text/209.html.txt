It was an idea that came into the pandemic as a logical solution for easing package deliveries in the city environment from businesses to customers. Facilitating deliveries away from the shops' doors and closer to customers' hotspots would be a win-win solution. We designed a method to transfer parcels "by bus" using vans moving in circular "bus-line" orbits at a schedule. Senders must present the package at the drop-in, and the Receivers will be delivered by showing the QR code issued at the drop-in.Principal ParametersStations: At primary market places as Shopping Malls or habitat places Driving Time: Station to Station in less than 30' drive.Vans obey the System at the rhythm of the ticking clock. Report automatically transmitting exchange transactions.A van missing the rhythm goes to "out of service" status until retransmitting. We explored the idea further and found it a win-win and cost-effective solution to same-day transfers for B2B and C2C transfers.We designed the e-platform to have the leading role and saw a broader international business opportunity. We added Revenue sharing of Expertise Partners to share lower risks as each invests in his expertise field.Couriers will significantly benefit from HourBus, as both parties focus on their expertise field. Couriers to deliver, HourBus to transfer.Owner & Founder Socrates Zygomalas registered HourBus to Athens Notarial Company, Ch. Steiros – F. Ktena, VAT EL099912284 Registration No41404/29-9-2020
HourBus introduces a new city transportation package, connecting city stations in hours. Purchase online HourBus ticket vouchers and book time-tunnel spaces by selecting drop-in and pick-up HourBus Stops and times. You drop your QRcode marked packages at the nearest HourBus servicing Driver on time. We deliver to the digitally verified consignee at the destination HourBus Stop on time. You: Serve your business omnichannel, reduce supply chain transport costs, never lose sales, and stay competitive.We: Prebook time-tunnel van spaces to profit in volume group transfers.It is a win-win sharing of the last mile. Deal?The contribution of transport costs to the total cost of the goods is high today, with the last mile the most challenging part. You need your merchandise located close to your customers and use your van-drivers fleet, transfer companies, or Couriers: the smaller the package, the more expensive to transfer on the same day. Many people shop online today. Many single items expect to transfer from city warehouses to end customers around. Courier transport cost reaches or exceeds the retail price, and you "quarantine" home for hours, waiting for the Courier to knock on the door.With HourBus, you only "rent" your packages occupied space when transferred. You can plan the dates, times, and benefit volume discounts, mutually benefiting from your pre-bookings.
