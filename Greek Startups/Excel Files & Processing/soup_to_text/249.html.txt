Kudzu is providing a set of products that helps members of IoT ecosystem focus only on their value proposition and guard themselves against the ever-changing world of IoT connectivity.(1) Kudzu Analytics is our infrastructure planning and predictive maintenance platform for IoT network deployments.(2) Kudzu Sprout is our hardware platform for rapid product development. It lets manufacturers develop only their sensor elements, while all the aspects of power management and communication are taken care of by us.(3) Kudzu Kernel is the firmware of Sprout that can be used to bring Kudzu Network Intelligence to existing products.(4) Kudzu Bridge is a subscription service that aggregates traffic from many different communication channels into just one, making application development easier.

Kudzu Technologies aims to make IoT technology accessible to everyone.Our services take away all the communication complexities out of the IoT ecosystem, enabling our clients to focus on their value proposition and not on the implementation details.Whether an IoT Device Manufacturer, a Large Scale Application Deployer, or a Full-Blown IoT Network Infrastructure Owner, Kudzu provides the tools to help you quickly get into the market with a reliable, robust and future-proof solution.
Many competitors fail to realize that the problem of connectivity is only solved when hardware, application, and infrastructure work together in a unison. There are many solutions for each aspect of this problem, but nobody is providing a unified solution.We are the only ones providing a systemic solution to IoT connectivity as a whole.And using our analytics platform, which collects real-time information from our customer deployments, we can not always stay ahead of the competition.Finally, we have a plethora of closed-source algorithms that are IP property of Kudzu and are scheduled to be patented.
