Objective
You are given a list of 711 notable startups in Greece.
Develop a tool to report in realtime the activities of any given company.


Next Steps:
    * [X] For each website in 'Greek Startups/Excel Files & Processing/
      SU_websites.txt' using BS check if the website returns a .html file
      for URL that does write 'yes' otherwise write 'no' with the URL.
      These results should be written to a .csv file.
    * [-] Solve for the URL links that returned 'no'.
    * [X] For each webpage extract the whole .html code
    * [X] For each webpage extract the human-friendly readable text from
      and store each in a text document
        * [-] Improve extraction
    * [-] In the tool be able to pass the text file to the GPT model


Analysis LLM (Improvement):
    * [-] Pass sliding window over text to capture all text
    * [-] Generate multiple reports given the same text to combine the reports
    * [-] For each line or group of lines analyze whether this is actually
          an 'activity' (could use POS-tagging)


Naive-Brute-Force POA (tasks):
    (Data Collection)
    * [X] Scrape or manually input each company name into a Python List
    * [-] For each company name find & download their company website or a website about them

    (Data Engineering)
    * [-] If multiple signals are used then organise the file structure into:
      Company name -> (then a subfolder for each signal i.e. GoogleTop5Results, LinkedIn, ...)
    * [X] For each downloaded webpage as a .html file perform cleaning for each file
        * [O] Cleaning is done but it only extracts <p> paragraphs this could be extended

    (Data Analysis)
    * [X] Pass sections of text to text-davinci-003 w/ a relevant prompt & store the output
    * [O] Experiment with POS-tagging
    * [-] Compile and process the output to contain only relevant information

    (Data Visualization)
    * [-] Create 1 to 7 useful reports
    * [-] Create an interactive interface with a visualization library
    * [-] Investigate which libraries or tools are best for creating the interactive visualization
          note libraries 'pygame' can be used with 'matplotlib'


Tool (Version-Alpha):
    (https://www.google.com/search?q=uk+company+names)
    * [X] Be able to input company name into interface
    * [X] Be able to pass URL to their company website
    * [-] Interface outputs progress text to the user
    * [-] Program searches, stores, & cleans their company website
    * [X] Program searches, stores, & cleans the top result
    * [O] Program searches, stores, & cleans the top 5 results
    * [-] For each stored webpage determine whether the page is related to
          our target company (delete or ignore pages that are not related)
    * [X] From each related and useful webpage generate a list of
          company activities


Tool (Version-Pre-Processed):
    * [-] Act on pre-processed data
